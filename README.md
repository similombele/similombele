Hello! I'm Similo Mbele, a self-taught web developer with a passion for technology and a vision for the future of robotics. I hold a degree in Social Sciences from the University of Free State, and my journey into coding began after my studies. Despite not having a background in math and science during high school, I chose to embrace the challenge of learning to code and haven't looked back since.

Living in a country with a high unemployment rate, I continually strive to improve myself and acquire new skills. I take pride in my analytical mindset and dedication to expanding my knowledge. My goal is to blend my interest in web development with my aspiration to delve into the field of robotics in the future.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
